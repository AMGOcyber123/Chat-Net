# Chat Net 
This is a simple web application where users can join any room or create a new room and chat to people anonymously. For this application, on the UI/UX aspect, my approach was to go for a minimilistic design that is light on eyes. The following image is the landing page when the user opens the application. 
Chat-Net is written using: 
  * Node.js
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * JavaScript
  

* ## *This is the landing page of the application.*

* ## *Once you create a room or Join a room a you recieve a message from the admin "Welcoming" new users and on the side you can see that a list of users in the room is maintained.*

* ## *After new users join they and you both can see who all are a part of the room.*
